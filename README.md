## About this project
This project is building a deck of cards using lists and the IEnumerable interface. Within the program, there are seperate classes for card types and deck behavior. The program initializes a deck of cards, and will soon add the ability to add a card to the deck, remove a card from the deck, and shuffle the deck.
